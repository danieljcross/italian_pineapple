## Overview

**Project Title**: Pizza Menu

**Project Description**: Takes the website for a pizza menu and adds a session storage feature that allows you to add items to the cart.

**Project Goals**: Find a new way to store data, even temporarily. Store this data without the use of a database. Do this by using session storage, which allows data to be saved locally. 

## Instructions for Build and Use

Steps to build and/or run the software:

1. To use the software, just go to the website. It is already up and running.

Instructions for using the software:

1. Click "add to cart" to add a pizza to the cart. 
2. The Reset button allows you to reset and new things to the cart.
